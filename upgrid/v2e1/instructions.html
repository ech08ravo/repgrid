<h2>Instructions  </h2>
<p>The objective of this grid exercise is to make explicit some of the ways in which you construe different kinds of writing. It is intended to demonstrate that different people can think similarly about things they have a (generally) shared understanding of, but use different ways of expressing their frameworks.
<p>The six examples here are the first paragraph of essays related to the FASS2200 Great Books and Radical Ideas course. More than one of these examples was generated using <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes" target="_blank">ChatGPT Jan 30 Version</a>.</p>
<p>You will probably be able to pick which are not student-written, but can you explain why?</p>
<p>The Repertory Grid Technique is based on <a href="https://www.kellysociety.org/kelly.html" target="_blank">the work of George Kelly</a>, and assumes each person has a unique way of interpreting the world. One way to understand this is through the process of triadic elicitation. It works like this:</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>You will be asked to consider three of the pieces of writing, for example, A, B, and C. You will indicate which one of these is different to the other two in some way, and describe in a short phrase the way you think it&rsquo;s different, and in another short phrase the way you think the other two are more similar.<br />
    <br />
  For example, if A was an apple, B was a banana, and C was a clementine, I might select B as different from the other two, saying it was "long and thin&quot;, with A and C &quot;generally spherical&quot;. These are your first <em>constructs, </em>the end poles of a continuum of differentiation<em>.</em></li>
  <li>You will then be asked to consider the other three pieces of writing as well, and to indicate on a scale of 1-5 the similarity of each one to each construct.<br />
    <br />
  For example, if D was a durian, E was an eggplant, and F was a Fig, I might rate D and E as close to the &quot;generally spherical&quot; pole, and my rating of E would depend on how spherical, or long and thin, it might be. </li>
  <li>You will next be asked to repeat the process and elicit different constructs for a different combination of three pieces of writing iteratively until you decide to finish or until all possible combinations of three have been exhausted.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>At the end of the process you will have a statistically-interpretable representation of how you think about these pieces of writing, which you can compare to and share with others. </p>
<p>You are welcome to use a pseudonym or otherwise anonymise your response. </p>
